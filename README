I define a data table as a document that describes a collection of
similar things, with similar information about each thing
(http://www.datakind.org/blog/whats-in-a-table/).
When we represent a data table in a grid, each row is an observation
(a thing), and each column is a variable.

Blizzard uses this table structure to find connections between arbitrary
data tables.
